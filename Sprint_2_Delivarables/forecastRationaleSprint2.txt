We as a team decided to use Fibonacci Series for pointing stories. (1 2 3 5 8 13)

Each team member can contribute 2 hours in a day and 10 days in a sprint.
Total team capacity per sprint is 80 hours.
1 story point equals 2 hours(1 day).

Total Team Capacity 40 points in a sprint.

Because of day offs team velocity is 34 for this sprint.
